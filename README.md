# Knowledge service

The memory of past grading for an AI assessment grader. It is one small
service in a larger set of microservices, built in Python and meant to run on
Kubernetes.

**Status: work in progress.** The API, the tests and the local Kubernetes setup
exist. The AWS setup (RDS, ECR, EKS) is not written yet.

## What it does

1. **Stores approved examples.** After an instructor approves a grade, the
   example (student work, grade and reasoning) is saved here along with an
   embedding, a list of 384 numbers describing what the text is about.
2. **Finds similar examples.** Given a new piece of student work, it returns
   the past examples closest in meaning, so grading stays consistent.

## What it owns

Its own Postgres database with the pgvector extension and a single
`examples` table. No other service reads that database directly. Other
services ask this service through its API.

The setup lives in [`db/init.sql`](db/init.sql). The table holds an example ID,
an assignment ID (a plain reference to another service), the student work, the
grade, the reasoning, the embedding and a timestamp. It stores no student
names.

## API

| Call | What it does |
|---|---|
| `POST /examples` | Save an approved example and compute its embedding |
| `GET /examples?assignment_id=...` | List the examples for one assignment (newest first, up to 100) |
| `POST /examples/search` | Return the examples most similar in meaning to some text, inside one assignment |
| `GET /health` | Report whether the service is alive |
| `GET /ready` | Report whether the service can reach its database |

Bad input is refused with a 422 that names the field and the reason but never
repeats what the caller sent.

## Tests

```
python -m venv .venv
.venv/Scripts/pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
.venv/Scripts/python -m pytest -v
```

The same tests run on every pull request, and the `main` branch rules require
them to pass before a merge.

`tests/test_k8s_manifests.py` builds the Kubernetes files for the laptop settings and
checks them against our rules (namespace, no Secret, fixed image tags, a locked-down
service pod and more). It needs `kubectl` and is skipped without it. Its self-tests
feed it deliberately broken files, so it cannot pass by never complaining.

`tests/test_database.py` needs a real database and is skipped when none is
configured. In the pipeline it runs against a throwaway Postgres that is built
from `db/init.sql` and the first-start password script, then destroyed. The
service login cannot delete, so these tests leave rows behind and refuse to run
unless the database is named `knowledge_test`. To run them yourself, start a
temporary container (use any passwords you like) and point the settings at it:

```
# In Git Bash on Windows, put MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 before "docker run". Without it
# Git Bash rewrites the folder paths and the setup scripts are never found.
docker run -d --name test-db \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=admin -e POSTGRES_DB=knowledge_test -e APP_PASSWORD=app \
  -v "$PWD/db/init.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/01-init.sql:ro" \
  -v "$PWD/k8s/overlays/local/set-app-password.sh:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/02-set-app-password.sh:ro" \
  -p 5432:5432 pgvector/pgvector:0.8.7-pg17

# wait about 20 seconds for the database to finish setting itself up, then:
DB_HOST=localhost DB_NAME=knowledge_test DB_USER=knowledge_app DB_PASSWORD=app \
  .venv/Scripts/python -m pytest -v tests/test_database.py

docker rm -f test-db
```

## Running on Kubernetes

The cluster files live in `k8s/`:

- `k8s/base/` holds what every environment shares (the Deployment and Service).
- `k8s/overlays/local/` holds the laptop settings, including a Postgres pod.
- `k8s/deploy.sh` looks at which cluster `kubectl` points at and applies the
  matching settings. It refuses any cluster it does not recognise.

```
bash k8s/deploy.sh --preview   # show what would be deployed
bash k8s/deploy.sh             # deploy
```

First time on a cluster: create the Secret by hand (the script prints the
command), then run `deploy.sh`. On its first start the database sets itself up
from `db/init.sql` and gives the `knowledge_app` login its password from the
Secret. To start the database from scratch:

```
kubectl delete -n knowledge deployment/knowledge-db pvc/knowledge-db-data
bash k8s/deploy.sh
```

The embedding model loads on the first save or search call, not at startup, so
the first call is slower. If it is ever preloaded at startup, add a
`startupProbe` to the Deployment so a slow start is not mistaken for a crash.

The database pod has a NetworkPolicy (`k8s/overlays/local/networkpolicy.yaml`) that
allows only the service pod to connect. It is written but not verified: Docker
Desktop's built-in cluster does not enforce NetworkPolicy, so a wrong pod still gets
through there. It has to be tested on a cluster that enforces policies.

On AWS the database is RDS, so the Postgres pod is not used there.

## Known limits

- Search uses pgvector's HNSW index with iterative scan switched on, which stops
  after 20000 scanned rows (`hnsw.max_scan_tuples`). A small assignment hidden
  behind tens of thousands of closer examples from other assignments could still
  return too few results. Nothing near that size exists today.
- The NetworkPolicy is written but not verified, because Docker Desktop's
  built-in cluster does not enforce it.

## Security notes

- This repo is public. It never contains passwords, API keys or Kubernetes
  Secret files, not even templates.
- The service's database login can read and add examples but cannot update or
  delete them.
- The database passwords live only in a Kubernetes Secret that is created by
  hand with a command. They are never written into any file.
