#!/usr/bin/env bash
# In plain English: this script deploys the knowledge service to whichever
# Kubernetes cluster your computer is currently pointed at, using the right
# settings for that cluster. It works out the environment by itself:
#   - the Docker Desktop cluster on your laptop  -> the "local" settings
#   - an AWS EKS cluster                         -> the "aws" settings
#   - anything else                              -> it refuses and stops
# That last rule is the safety net: laptop settings can never be applied to a
# real cluster by accident, or the other way round.
#
# It never creates or reads passwords. (On the laptop it also hands the table
# setup file db/init.sql to the database pod, which contains no secrets.) The Secret must already exist; if it
# does not, the script tells you the command to type and stops.
