# In plain English: finds the saved examples whose MEANING is closest to the given
# text. It turns the text into 384 numbers, then lets the database rank saved
# examples by how close their numbers are ("cosine distance", using the fast
# index). Each result gets a similarity score: 1 means practically identical, lower
# means less alike. This only reads; it changes nothing.
#
# Where it looks depends on one quick question: "does this assignment have any
# examples of its own?"
#   - Yes: it searches ONLY inside that assignment. Its own examples always win, even
#     if another assignment holds one that sounds closer. Results are flagged
#     same_assignment = true.
#   - No, and the caller asked to borrow (fallback_to_all = true): it searches across
#     ALL assignments, so a brand-new assignment still gets something to learn from.
#     Results are flagged same_assignment = false and carry their own assignment_id, so
#     the grader can say they came from a different assignment.
#   - No, and the caller did not ask to borrow: it returns nothing. An ID the service
#     has never seen (a typo, a made-up ID) must not be able to read other
#     assignments' work. The service cannot tell a real new assignment from a made-up
#     ID, because the assessment service owns the list of assignments, so the CALLER
#     says when borrowing is wanted.
#
# The fast index only looks at about 40 candidates from ALL assignments and filters
# afterwards, so a small assignment surrounded by closer rows from other assignments
# could come back with too few results. The first statement switches on pgvector's
# "keep looking until enough rows pass the filter" mode (iterative scan) for this
# one transaction. That fixes the common case. It still stops after pgvector's scan
# limit (hnsw.max_scan_tuples, 20000 rows by default), so a small assignment hidden
# behind tens of thousands of closer rows from other assignments could still come
# back short. If that ever matters: raise the limit, rank inside one assignment
# exactly (filter first, then sort), or split the table by assignment.
