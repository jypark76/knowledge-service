# In plain English: these tests check HOW the search talks to the database, without
# needing a database. A recording stand-in for the connection captures every
# statement the search sends, in order, and hands back the answers we script for it.
#
# What they pin down:
#   - the search switches on pgvector's "keep looking" mode (iterative scan) first;
#   - it then asks one quick question: "does this assignment have any examples?";
#   - if yes, the search stays INSIDE that assignment;
#   - if no, the search looks across ALL assignments (the cold-start fallback);
#   - every result says which assignment it came from and whether that is the same
#     assignment that was asked about (the same_assignment flag).
