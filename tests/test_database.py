# In plain English: these tests run the real service against a real Postgres
# database, so they check the parts the other tests cannot: saving, listing and
# searching for real, and that the service's limited login really cannot change
# or delete anything.
#
# SAFETY: the service's login cannot delete, so these tests cannot clean up after
# themselves. Every test adds rows with a brand new random assignment ID and
# leaves them behind. That is fine for a throwaway database and a disaster for a
# real one. So the tests refuse to run unless the database is named
# "knowledge_test". The pipeline creates a fresh one for every run and throws it
# away afterwards. To run these on your own computer, start a temporary Postgres
# container yourself (see the README) and point the DB_* settings at it.

# rows in one assignment and one far row in another. The ordinary assignment index
# would normally rescue the query, so the filter is written in a way that index
# cannot be used, which leaves the HNSW index as the only fast path. It checks the
